# FinStack MCP

**90 free tools for Indian + global markets. Works inside Claude, Cursor, and any MCP client.**

Open-source market intelligence for Indian equities, global markets, and MCP-native AI workflows.
Ask one question like `Should I buy Reliance?` and get debate, sentiment, smart-money, risk, peer context, and ranking in one stack.

```bash
pip install finstack-mcp
```

Ask Claude things like:

```text
"Give me a full stock brief on Reliance"
-> 6 AI agents debate: FII Desk + Algo Trader + Value Investor + Retail Pulse + Macro Analyst + Options Flow
-> Consensus: BUY/HOLD/SELL with reasoning

"Is someone accumulating HDFC Bank quietly?"
-> Checks OI buildup, block deals, promoter buying, volume spike simultaneously

"What's the social buzz on TCS before results?"
-> StockTwits + Reddit + Economic Times -> 67% bullish | Signal: HOLD

"Will Nifty go up tomorrow?"
-> RSI + FII flow + PCR + VIX + G-Sec + GIFT Nifty -> 63% probability up

"Scan my portfolio for risk"
-> Sector concentration, pledged promoters, FII exposure, XIRR, diversification score

"Is this Telegram stock tip channel a scam?"
-> Accuracy %, avg return %, pump-and-dump probability scored
```

## Why this is different

- Built for Indian markets first, not as a US-market wrapper with a few NSE tickers added later
- MCP-native, so it works inside Claude, Cursor, and other agent workflows instead of being just another dashboard
- Combines data, scoring, debate, and research workflows instead of forcing users to stitch 5 paid tools together
- Includes tools competitors usually do not offer at all: stock debate, watchlist ranking, stock timeline, Telegram tracker, GST-to-stock context, and budget analyzer

## Remote MCP publishing roadmap

If you want `finstack-mcp` to move beyond local desktop config and become available through connector ecosystems, keep the local `python -m finstack.server` setup for developers and add a hosted remote MCP version for public distribution.

### What to build for remote HTTP

- Expose FinStack through a public MCP endpoint over HTTPS, preferably Streamable HTTP or SSE.
- Add OAuth before opening it to outside users.
- Keep tool descriptions narrow, clear, and safe.
- Add rate limiting, monitoring, and a visible support contact.
- Publish a privacy policy and terms before any official submission.

### ChatGPT / OpenAI path

- Host a remote MCP server that is reachable over HTTPS.
- Test it first as a custom connector or custom app in ChatGPT.
- Add connector-friendly read tools such as `search` and `fetch` if you want broader compatibility with OpenAI connector flows.
- Keep FinStack-specific tools like `get_stock_brief`, `get_stock_debate`, `get_social_sentiment`, and `analyze_portfolio` as domain tools on top.

### Claude / Anthropic path

- First make sure the server works as a custom connector.
- Then prepare for directory review instead of assuming instant listing.
- Anthropic reviews third-party MCP servers for safety, security, privacy, and compatibility before directory inclusion.
- Directory listing is not guaranteed even if the server is technically valid.

### Practical submission checklist

- Public HTTPS MCP endpoint
- OAuth login flow
- Stable server uptime
- Safe tool scope and descriptions
- Privacy policy
- Terms of service
- Support email or issue tracker
- Clear docs and example prompts
- No tool behavior that encourages bypassing model safety policies

### Recommended product split

- Local stdio MCP: best for developers and power users
- Hosted remote MCP: best for connectors and wider distribution
- Separate hosted FinStack web UI: best place for premium visuals like Agent Battle

This keeps MCP as the execution layer and your own frontend as the premium experience.

## Accuracy and evaluation

FinStack should be presented as a decision-support engine, not as a guaranteed prediction machine.

- `get_stock_signal_score` is a ranking layer for triage, screening, and automation
- `evaluate_signal_quality` is an honest proof layer for the price-action core
- the full live system also uses sentiment, insider activity, pledge risk, macro, and peer context, so one backtest number should not be marketed as "the accuracy of FinStack"
- safest language for users: `signal engine`, `research assistant`, `multi-factor ranking`, and `decision-support`

## Troubleshooting

**Claude says "finstack not found" after install**
- Restart Claude Desktop fully (quit from system tray, not just close)
- Config path on Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Verify Python is in PATH: `python --version`

**pip install fails**
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install finstack-mcp
```

**Angel One TOTP fails**
- TOTP secret ≠ password. Find it in Angel One app → Profile → Enable TOTP → secret key
- Install: `pip install finstack-mcp[broker]`

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/finstacklabs/finstack-mcp.git
cd finstack-mcp
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest -q
```

PRs welcome. Adding a new broker: create `src/finstack/data/broker_X.py` and register in `tools/`.
